# COVID19-Prophet-Forecasting
Predictive modeling of COVID-19 trends using machine learning (Prophet) and policy impact assessment.

**🦠 COVID-19 Trend Forecasting with Prophet 📊**

**Project Summary:** An application of the Facebook Prophet library for short- to medium-term forecasting of key COVID-19 metrics (e.g., confirmed cases, fatalities). The solution highlights modern time series techniques, including automated trend change detection and the incorporation of external factors (holidays/events).

**Key Technologies: 🐍 Python, Pandas, Prophet
Primary Dataset: 🌍 JHU/WHO COVID-19 Time Series Data
Model Type: 📈 Prophet (Additive Regression Model)
Status: ✅ Complete**

**1. Project Overview 🌟**

This project aims to provide a reliable predictive tool for the COVID-19 pandemic's trajectory. By using Facebook Prophet, an additive model designed for business forecasting, we leverage its strength in handling non-linear trends, complex seasonality, and major shift points (or "changepoints"). The resulting forecasts are crucial for public health bodies, hospitals, and governments in planning resource allocation and policy adjustments.

**2. Key Features 🔑**

  ➡️ Automated Changepoint Detection: Automatically identified major shifts in the infection rate trend, corresponding to events like lockdowns, new variants, or vaccine rollouts. 🚨

  ➡️ Robust Uncertainty Estimation: Generated clear confidence intervals for all forecasts, quantifying the risk associated with predictions. 🔮

  ➡️ Component Analysis: Decomposed the time series into Trend, Weekly Seasonality, and Yearly Seasonality components to isolate drivers of change. 📈

  ➡️ Policy Integration: Ability to incorporate custom regressor effects (e.g., major holidays or state-mandated restrictions) to refine predictive accuracy. 📅

**3. Model Performance 🎯**

  👉Model Used: Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) Model.

  👉Training Method: Split data into training and testing sets to validate predictive power on unseen data.

  👉Primary Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Chosen for interpretability, allowing easy communication of average daily prediction error.

  👉Diagnostics: Analyzed residual plots (normality and zero mean) to confirm the model's appropriateness and ensure residuals are white noise. 🧪

**4. Technical Implementation 💻**

**Technologies Used**

   👉 Language: 🐍 Python
   👉 Core Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Prophet, Matplotlib/Plotly
   👉 Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Colab

 **Dataset**

  👉Name: Global or National COVID-19 Time Series Data.

  👉Period: Daily data from the start of the pandemic up to the analysis date.

  👉Characteristics: Highly volatile, with distinct non-linear trend segments (waves) and weekly seasonality (reporting delays).

 **Methodology**

   ✅ Data Preprocessing: Transforming the source data into the Prophet-required format (ds for datetime, y for metric value). 🧼
   ✅ Changepoint Configuration: Manually setting changepoints or allowing Prophet's automatic detection to locate sudden trend changes. 🔎
   ✅ Seasonality and Holiday Modeling: Incorporating weekly and yearly seasonality and defining custom events as "holidays" to model their unique impact.
   ✅ Model Fitting and Evaluation: Training the model on historical data and evaluating its fit and cross-validation performance.
   ✅ Forecasting and Visualization: Generating future predictions and using Plotly for rich, interactive plots of the forecast and its components. 🚀

**5. Key Findings💡**

  **Top Predictive Features**

  🌟 Changepoints: The model successfully highlighted critical changepoint dates that directly correlated with significant public events (e.g., first wave peak, holiday spikes), providing clear causal inference for trend changes.
  🌟 Weekly Seasonality: Identified a consistent, strong weekly seasonality (lower reporting on weekends), which is crucial for accurate short-term predictions.

**Data Quality Insights**

  👉 Data Consistency: Prophet's robustness was beneficial in handling reporting lags and noise inherent in daily public health data.
  👉 Trend Flexibility: Demonstrated that a simple linear model is insufficient for pandemic data and that Prophet's piecewise linear trend is necessary.

**6. Business Applications 💼**

  👉 Resource Allocation: Forecasting peak hospitalizations or case counts allows hospitals to plan for ICU capacity, ventilator needs, and staffing levels. 🏥
  👉 Policy Decision Support: Provides predictive scenarios to policymakers to evaluate the potential impact of easing or tightening restrictions. 👉 Vaccine/Medication Distribution: Predicts future demand and optimal timing for distributing critical health resources.

**7. How to Use ⚙**️

    👉 Clone the Repository:

      git clone [https://github.com/lakshmibhavani7/COVID19-Prophet-Forecasting.git](https://github.com/lakshmibhavani7/COVID19-Prophet-Forecasting.git)
    cd COVID19-Prophet-Forecasting

    👉 Install Dependencies (Note: Prophet requires specific dependencies):

      pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly prophet


    👉 Run Analysis: Open and execute the Jupyter Notebook:

      jupyter notebook covid19_prophet.ipynb


**8. File Structure 📂**

├── covid19_prophet.ipynb           # Primary analysis, modeling, and forecasting notebook
├── COVID_data.csv                  # The raw time series data file (or similar name)
└── README.md                       # Project documentation (This file)


**9. Results Interpretation 📖**

The Prophet model provides forecasts broken down by components (trend, weekly, yearly), which is highly valuable for interpretation. We can definitively state which portion of the change is due to long-term pandemic fatigue (trend) versus which is due to reporting effects (weekly seasonality), offering actionable insights beyond a simple number.

**10. Future Enhancements ✨**

   💡 Hyperparameter Tuning: Systematically optimize Prophet parameters (changepoint_prior_scale, seasonality_prior_scale) using cross-validation to maximize out-of-sample performance.

   💡 Live Dashboard: Implement a Streamlit or Dash application to allow users to interactively select regions and forecast horizons. ☁️

   💡 Exogenous Regressors: Incorporate more external variables (e.g., average temperature, mobility data) to build a more robust model.
